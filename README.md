Adafruit-CharLCDPlate
=====================

My Improvements to the Adafruit CharLCDPlate Library

Added a simple, lcd.input function, which removes the need for the user to import the MCP23017 library.
Also, the user no longer needs to add a not befor each button statement, because it is now found in the function input().
